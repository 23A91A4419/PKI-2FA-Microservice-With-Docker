# Submission Instructions

I have automatically fixed your git remote URL to point to `PKI-2FA-Microservice-With-Docker`.

## Next Step
You must run the following command to push your code (using `--force` to overwrite the empty/initialized repo on GitHub):

```powershell
git push -u origin main --force
```

## Submission Data
*   **Repo URL**: `https://github.com/23A91A4419/PKI-2FA-Microservice-With-Docker`
*   **Commit Hash**: `243bddfe2c07e0d540d7ae8e306725dacb2a63e7`
*   **Encrypted Signature**: Use the single-line string from the `python scripts/generate_proof.py` output.

You are ready to submit!
